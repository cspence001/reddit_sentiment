53,"Yes there are a lot of people swept up into this doge “movement” that don’t understand anything about blockchain or even basic economics. I used to get frustrated just like you and have spent far to much time in arguments trying to help people learn about how this stuff actually works.

But I’ve realized something - Dogecoin helps spread the message of a decentralized future. If only 50% of these new investors understand the power of decentralized currencies that is a MAJOR win for the entire ecosystem. However I think 50% is conservative and more so I think a small percentage will start to look much more deeply into this world and either become real crypto investors or could maybe even help build the next great DeFi application or even something brand new.

So yes the uneducated posts are annoying but it’s a memecoin what do you expect? I’m so glad doge is pumping because it means the majority of people didn’t get burned by that initial pump and FOMO investment.

63,"I bought doge at 0.055 (CAD) and sold at 0.092 (CAD). This was my first foray into crypto's. I made a profit. Which is all I wanted to do. I think this sub (r/cryptocurrency) saved me some money. I am VERY impressionable and got caught up in the hype. Once I learned more about market caps I had the ""ah ha"" moment. I  sold and piled into BTC and ETH. I have some in XML for kicks and giggles.  Something to play with. I wouldn't be surprised if BTC and ETH tank a bunch over the next few weeks. Which is fine..that's what crypto's do. I have confidence in these coins that they can and will recover and grow some more. 

All that said, the gains experienced over the past 2 months or so, over the entire market, have me a little nervous. Are we looking at new floors or are we looking at a bubble? Time will tell. 

Either way, after spending a solid day or two reading and learning about crypto's I see now that this is a long term investment strategy with opportunities to make small, quick profits, thanks to the volatility of the market. 

So, I will keep some fiat available at all times to take advantage of the opportunities as they jump up. I'll set clear profit goals and once reached, bail out and invest in the quality coins.

Dogecoin serves as a kind of leveraged play on crypto, in that it tends to swing widely based on the mood of the crypto market. So rather than buying bitcoin on margin I hold dogecoin, and skip the lending fees and risk of liquidation from a margin call.

73,"Sure, let's look at those numbers.

First off, that figure represents a current inflation rate of 5% _per year_. Do you really think that 5% inflation _per year_ has _any_ bearing whatsoever on a price that moves that much _in an hour_? It's mind-boggling how you think this is so important.

Second, as it is a _fixed_ amount, the inflation rate actually goes down every year. In 10 years, it will be 2.5%, in 20 years 1.25%. So at some point this coin actually becomes _deflationary_.

But I don't think you want to talk about that. I think you want to give the impression that if people buy this coin, the value bleeds linearly until it's all gone. You're wrong in your understanding, and you're wrong to push this narrative.

FIAT-Currencies have exactly the same ""feature"". It's called inflation.

if you want a currency that is actually used to buy stuff, a slightly below inflation devaluation is absolutely a bonus.

159,"Apparently there's still mass confusion in this market and I'm going to clear this up for everyone that still doesn't understand what supply / issuance is all about.

Everyone should imagine that each crypto currency has a supply of 1.000000000000000000 at any moment in time and that it is divible (up to 18 decimals in practice). So if you own 1 out of a million of the total supply, then you would own 0.000001000000000000 coins.

So now take BTC supply today = 18,679,906 https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin

Let's say that 18,679,906 BTC = 1.000000000000000000

Now you own 1 in 1 million of the BTC supply. So you own:

0.000001000000000000 * 18,679,906 = 18.679906 BTC

Now we want to do the same for Dogecoin. Total Dogecoins total supply is  129,141,280,838. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin. Thus:

0.000001000000000000 * 129,141,280,838 = 129141.280838 DOGE

Now let's look at issuance. Dogecoin issues 5 billion coins per year. So the issuance is:

5,000,000,000 / 129,141,280,838 * 100 ~ 3.8%

So, to maintain your 1 in a million position in dogecoin, you need need to purchase an additonal 3.8% per year so that if Dogecoins valuation goes up, you still hold a fixed percentage of the total supply. So you would need to buy:

129141.280838 * 0.038 = 4907.36867184 DOGE.

If you were to do the same math with Bitcoin, to maintain your 1 in a million ownership, first figure out the inflation, at 6.5 BTC per block thats 328,500 BTC in 2021, thus inflation is:

328,500 / 18,679,906 *100 ~ 1.75%

So you would need to purchase:

18.679906 * 0.0175 = 0.326898355 BTC per year.


Now note that the Dogecoin supply issuance only decreases every year because it's linear (5 billion issued every year so inflation is less). This is why it doesn't make sense to talk about issuance in an absolute sense (number big), but rather as a fraction of the total supply and your percent ownership of that supply.",t3_moll3g,1618164057.0,2021-04-11 18:00:57,-0.1154,0.011,0.976,0.013,Negative

From what I can see dogecoin has been **increasing** in value. 
If the code is “meant” to decrease in value, does that mean the code is failing? Would that also mean it would fail to “work against you” per your first claim?

Is it “too late” to get into Dogecoin now like it was “too late” to get in on Bitcoin at its ATH of $32? And its ATH of $1200? And its ATH of $20000? And its ATH of $50000?

187,"While I agree that Dogecoin is a meme and not worth investing it, it seems you are spreading misinformation.

Dogecoin is a clone of Litecoin, with some tweaks. Both have hard supply caps.

> Dogecoin is a coin that produces 14 million a day and 5 billion a year. 

I know million and billion are scary words to some people, but the raw number of coins mined does not matter. The number of coins mined *relative* to supply is what matters. Mining a billion coins a day wouldn't matter if there were already 100 trillion coins in supply.

> I did a bit of research into it, and the code is written to work against you.

What does this even mean?

> In other words, the coin is literally meant to decrease in value.

At the moment, ~113 billion Dogecoins have been mined out of a hard cap of 127 billion, that's 88%. Compare this to Bitcoin, where 18m of 21m have been mined, a ratio of 86%. Bitcoin's 14% of deflationary space is more than Dogecoin's 12% of deflationary space (by more deflationary space, I mean it has more room to decrease it's own price by increasing supply). By your logic, Bitcoin is designed to decrease in value.

> And I love pumping coins, but it’s too late to get in on Dogecoin now. 50% of the supply is in a few wallets. One dump and it’s gone.

What the fuck are you even talking about?

From a very naive macro viewpoint, price=demand/supply. In the last ""pump and dump"", there was a huge increase in Dogecoin's demand.

335,"""bUt IT hAs nO uSE CAseS!""

Is the mantra around here to hate on Doge. 

What you forgot about is the second half of this sub's name ""currency"".  

It makes for a damn decent currency that is faster, cheaper and more fun than Bitcoin.   The fact that it is mildly inflationary keeps it useful as a currency instead of a ""store of value"". 

I saw a recent transaction that moved several million USD in DOGECOIN for the cost of 2 Doge.  That was about $0.15 at the time... to move +$1M USD.

Like it or not, their is VALUE in the high profile shills like Musk and Snoop.

People like dogecoin and it brings many newcomers in.  SOMETHING is going to be the currency to BTC's store of value.

Why NOT Dogecoin?

BTC, ETH, and ADA had clear documentations on its use; the first two currencies had seen literal use, with BTC as the original cryptocurrency and ETH as the (AFAIK) the most powerful altcoin. I have little to no knowledge about ADA though. Unlike XRP, ADA seemed to be relatively decentralized.

I used to think back then in 2010s it was a scam and it's only for trading; it only turns to be true if you put too little time to studying its potential benefits as an asset.

The DOGE supply is uncapped. 5 billion DOGE is released each year. There are 128B today, so it's inflating by 4%pa. Each year your DOGE should be worth 4% less unless (at current prices), $250 million of new money joins up (every year).

An argument could be made that in 20 years or so, when there are 228B DOGE, now inflation is only 2.2% And in 40 years, only 1.5% But your money will be worth half or a third of today's value respectively at that time unless more 2-3x as much money joins the dogeflation party.

451,"I have been shorting DOGE quite a bit and by extension following the price very closely in the last couple of months. 

DOGE has been very closely pegged to BTC at around 100 sats for the past month or so but during the peaks has gone to 110 even 115 sats - during the troughs it's gone down to 97 but has so far held that resistance. 

Since we have just had a correction it's now sitting about that 97-98 range but will likely overtake 100 again when the next pump event happens (such as an Elon Musk tweet)

My recommendation would be to watch the charts like a hawk and hold off selling until the next pump - from experience pumps in DOGE last for about 30-45 minutes and are followed by a similar dump of the same length and are approx 5-10%

If you can catch the pump up swap it for bitcoin. 

Holding on to the DOGE for more than a couple of months is a bad idea in my opinion. I think when we get a big correction and/or the bear market starts there will be a very big dump and DOGE will likely go back to pre-2021 levels.

Currently the market is pumping again so it's likely DOGE will overtake that 100 sat benchmark again in the next week. If it gets to 110 again I would definitely trade it for BTC.

551,"I love Doge! Not because it's made me money (they were basically free) but because the idea and use was literally a joke. We used to tip Doge back and forth just for a great meme or epic comment. The line was always!!! 1 Doge=1 Doge. I still have 6942.0 Doge. I did it for the lulz. Anyone seriously asking about crypto I start with ""don't buy Doge"". But Doge coins are OG'S and hold a special place in my memories. I wouldn't invest in them now but back in the day? Like I said it was strictly for the LULZ...why can't we have a laugh?
