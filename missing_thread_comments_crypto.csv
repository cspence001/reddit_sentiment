334,"jesus christ, so apparently I am shadowbanned on r/wallstreetbets for mentioning DeFi. I can't see my post there and I don't have enough comment carma to submit something here at r/cc, so I'll just post it here: 

What happened today shows once and for all how Wall Street feels about you. About me. About each and everyone of us. We're their cows to be milked for every fucking penny we have. And then, every ten years, they crash the market, no one goes to jail, rinse and repeat. While all of us doe not go via start and do not get 200 bucks. Hell, obviously we don't even deserve more than 600 dollars in a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC THAT LASTS ALMOST A YEAR ALREADY!

As u/frank__costello point out so eloquently here: ""This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.""

Now they took away our option to pump $GME even higher. Because we used their own fucking rules against them. Because we ORGANIZED. But this can only last in a space outside of their grasp. It's not enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them WHENEVER YOU WANT. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

This is why we need DeFi

Decentralised Finance allows us to trade whenever, wherever, without the need for a middle man. Without Wall Street. No one can turn off a decentralised exchange. No one can turn off the buy button. You are in charge. I am. We all are.

The situation with doge is just blind hype/meme pump, which will result in a dump and some hurt buttholes. +200% 24h for what amounts to pretty much no reason is _not_ sustainable.

872,"I always come when called :) u/iwillnottryagain asked me to write something inspirational. So I will do my best, in the way only Victor Cobra can. 

It‚Äôs been a pretty good year so far! I finally took out my initial investment (some would say this is a bad idea, and yes I‚Äôd have more money now if I didn‚Äôt do this ) but I have a small income as a graduate student, and it gives me some financial security. In doing this, I also followed a plan I made 2 years ago for profit-taking during the next bull market. So far, so good! Just following through on a financial goal feels great. I highly recommend! 

Now for me it‚Äôs just about managing my crypto without driving myself crazy. I‚Äôm somewhat tuned out from the market right now because there are so many projects out there and the pumps drive me crazy if I think about how much money I could have made. And of course I‚Äôm essentially working full-time while in school. 

To everyone who‚Äôs just getting into this market: Make sure you have a plan. Getting in for the long term is a lot less stressful. But for those pump chasers: If you make 10x gains from something like DOGE it doesn‚Äôt hurt to take at least some profit. Most likely, prices will come back down to earth eventually. And that gravitational process is a long one. 

When I first got into this market, I wanted to escape the banks. Then I realized I could make money as well. I thought I could go ‚Äúin and out‚Äù and make a quick buck. Maybe pay for a trip to Japan. But then the bear market happened, and that‚Äôs when I decided I was in it for the long haul.  In order to bide my time while I waited, I learned some TA and developed my own theories of how the market works. It‚Äôs been quite an intellectual journey! And not an easy one, waiting three years for something like this to materialize. There were many moments where I just considered it money lost. 

Do what‚Äôs best for you, given your own financial situation! And remember, there will ALWAYS be a better trade. As long as a project seems very likely to be around for a while, given its team, usage, and financial backing, a mostly hands-off approach can do wonders for your mental health. When the market is booming it can be really hard to sit on your hands. I‚Äôm no exception. I decided to swap some ETH for LTC the other day because the ratio seems like it will rebound from these levels eventually. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong. And I‚Äôm totally okay with that. I‚Äôm just enjoying this as it unfolds.

\- There is no way that 45K is holding as the sell-off is extremely weak from this point.  This is understandable as everyone and their moms are buying dips.  

\- So I think we settle into 47-50K range, before meeting a real resistance and making some huge corrections (e.g. 2-3K correction).  

\- Assuming that we do not blast off into 50-60K range in the next 12-24 hours, 50K would indicate a daily of 25-30% gain for the BTC.  I think that is a reasonable number for this run where a mini-correction would occur and the SATs will recover big time from this point.

Yes, it will likely tank.

Yes, there will be whales profiting off of naive people.

Yes, a lot of people will get burnt, newbies, FOMO-ers and over-leveraged alike.

Yes, it does cast a less-than-favourable light on other crypto.

When you setup an account on coinbase, you implicitly get a login for **Coinbase Pro.** The User Interface is a little more complex than the app, but you should be able to understand it (please feel free to DM me if you dont). I dont think i can link the URL for Coinbase Pro but you shouldnt have problem finding the site via google (or DM if required). Use the exact same credentials to log in here.   


Why Coinbase Pro? You pay a fraction of the fees you would on Coinbase, and dont have to buy at market price. So you save on fees and get to determine the price you want to acquire your asset at.   


In the UK at least, instant buying via the app using a debit card incurs a **3.99% fee**, which is extortionate and in the long term will eat into your potential profits.
