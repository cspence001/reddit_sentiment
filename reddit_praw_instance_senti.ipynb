In Feb it went from .008 to .08 to .029 in just a few days, but everyone who believed in it stayed around, bought the dip, and created a stable floor. It then drew in new investors and consolidated for what seemed like forever but relatively quickly in comparison to other crytos. Then in april, after a lot of hard work, we got liftoff all the way to .47, the bubble popped to .16, the believers stuck around, and now we're building our floor as we speak. it's getting stronger and stronger, and with a lot of hard work and patience, we'll reach our next milestone.
