Every time we hit a milestone (.08, .50) we essentially do have a bubble that grows and pops. But the believers stick around and build from the rubble. In Feb it went from .008 to .08 to .029 in just a few days, but everyone who believed in it stayed around, bought the dip, and created a stable floor. It then drew in new investors and consolidated for what seemed like forever but relatively quickly in comparison to other crytos. Then in april, after a lot of hard work, we got liftoff all the way to .47, the bubble popped to .16, the believers stuck around, and now we're building our floor as we speak. it's getting stronger and stronger, and with a lot of hard work and patience, we'll reach our next milestone.

We all know the value in Doge is not in holding, we hear the negatives that because there‚Äôs no  cap etc etc ... 

True value is turning this into an actual currency and get more businesses to accept Doge as a payment right ?

The issue I‚Äôm seeing is all these ‚ÄúHold‚Äù posts and yet I don‚Äôt see anyone promoting to use their Doge and support businesses that accept it.

What advantages is the community giving businesses to accept Doge ? Right now most businesses are just capitalizing on the free advertising it‚Äôs giving them, but what about long term?

Most of you might now realize this, but it literally takes 5 min to sign up and accept Doge on Shopify. It would also take the two seconds to turn it off if a business isn‚Äôt getting any ‚Äúextra‚Äù incentive to utilize it because it is extra fees especially on Shopify.

\- When it goes UP, I profit

\- When it goes DOWN, I buy more so I can profit even more when it goes UP again.

Sometimes the simplest strategy its the best.

I like to remember myself that no one has yet lost money by holding DOGE, and we are not even close to what we can become.

EDIT: As I'm not putting money I will need anytime soon and can even see it at 99% down.

I trully believe at Dogecoin, just look the size of our subreddit (1.6m), its DOUBLE than r/ethereum  (816k) and more than half of r/bitcoin (2.8m).

DOGE its not unlimited as some people think, it has a decreasing annual-cap, today at 3,9% (Less than BTC at the same age 8yo).

Of course the hype will not be always UP and we will not be always at the news, but we have a solid community that can hold us during calm waters, and eventually we will see anothers bull runs.

Today you may call me crazy, but I'll HOLD my doges till $100.I don't trade, I just buy more with any money I have that I will not miss  


EDIT2: I believe DOGE its the only coin today with real chance of becoming mainstream at the future. People like to compare BTC with Gold, how many people you know that buy groceries with gold? Thats it. We need this much coins that DOGE has, today it may seems like a lot, but its so everybody can have a slice, and it won't affect the price of the coin, that I believe will surprass ETH current price (2k)",1619464243.0,2021-04-26 19:10:43,0.9287,0.027,0.893,0.08,Positive
